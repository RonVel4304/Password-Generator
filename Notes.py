# In what way can I improve this now?
# Add it so the user can generate multiple passwords
# Finished ^

# Would you like a hard or easy password? (Easy password is what you have at first)
# Easy password is what you have completed, then hard is a random special
# char at the start ot center of you adj and noun
# Finished ^

# Hard password will have a special character included in the front, or the center of the adjective and noun
# Finished ^

# Randomize Characters in Extreme
# Finished ^

# Bug: After an invalid user input, input is always considered incorrect even when it's fine
# Fixed ^ using --print(user_choice)-- in --while user_choice not in password_choices:--
# Accidentally used user_loop instead of user_choice

# Turn it into a functioning program window :OOOO
